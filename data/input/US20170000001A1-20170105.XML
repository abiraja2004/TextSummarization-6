<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A debris clearing apparatus according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 27</figref> of the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a side elevation view of a conventional planter row unit <b>10</b> to which is directly mounted a debris clearing apparatus <b>11</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The planter unit <b>10</b> may include many elements, but for purposes of describing the present invention, the planter unit <b>10</b> is shown as including a frame <b>12</b> to which are mounted a seed hopper <b>13</b>, an insecticide hopper <b>14</b>, and plural ground engaging members. The illustrated ground engaging members include a pair of laterally spaced furrow opening discs (where one disc is shown as element <b>15</b>), plural gauge wheels (where one gauge wheel is shown as element <b>16</b>), and a trailing furrow closing wheel <b>17</b>. All of the aforementioned ground engaging members <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> either ride on the surface of the soil S, or penetrate the soil S as part of the seed planting operation. The planter unit <b>10</b> is shown as traveling in the direction of arrow <b>18</b> during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Attached to a forward portion of the planter unit's frame <b>12</b> is a pivoting parallel linkage arrangement <b>19</b> for facilitating mounting of the planter row unit <b>10</b> to the tool bar <b>20</b> of an agricultural implement. The planter unit <b>10</b> is coupled to the tool bar <b>20</b> by means of the pivoting parallel linkage arrangement <b>19</b> and a mounting plate <b>21</b>. The mounting plate <b>21</b> is secured to an aft surface of the tool bar <b>20</b> by conventional couplers, such as U-bolts (not shown in the figure for simplicity). The parallel linkage arrangement <b>19</b> includes links <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> pivotally coupled at their respective aft ends to a forward portion of the planter row unit's frame <b>12</b> and at their respective forward ends to the mounting plate <b>21</b> to allow for vertical displacement between the tool bar <b>20</b> and the planter row unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Attached to a forward portion of the planter row unit's frame <b>12</b> is the debris clearing apparatus <b>11</b>. The debris clearing apparatus <b>11</b> can be mounted to the frame <b>12</b> in the manner disclosed in Applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 8,393,407, which is incorporated herein by reference. The debris clearing apparatus <b>11</b> can also be used with other agricultural implements, such as fertilizer applicators, strip till machines, seeders, and soil testing implements, and the configuration of the mounting brackets used to attach the apparatus to such implements will vary depending on the particular implement.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The debris clearing apparatus <b>11</b> includes a pair of substantially flat discs <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B that are rotatably mounted via a hub <b>25</b> to a bracket arm <b>26</b> attached to a mounting bracket <b>27</b> on the implement. The discs <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B have a center hole <b>28</b> for receiving the hub <b>25</b> and a plurality of mounting holes <b>29</b> for receiving mounting bolts <b>30</b>. The discs <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B are mounted to the bracket arm <b>26</b> for rotation about generally horizontal axes with the discs <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B toed-in toward each other relative to a direction of travel <b>18</b> of the implement. In this mounting arrangement, a geometric plane containing the first disc <b>24</b>A intersects a geometric plane containing the second disc <b>24</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The flat discs <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B each have a first side and an opposing second side. A plurality of teeth <b>32</b> extend from a periphery of each disc <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B. In the illustrated embodiment, each disc <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B has 12 teeth equally spaced around the disc at 30-degree intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be understood that the discs <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B are basically the same as each other, except that the beveled surfaces of the teeth (described below) are formed on the opposite side of the disc <b>24</b>A as compared to disc <b>24</b>B. Accordingly, the discs <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B will be described interchangeably herein by simply referring to them as discs <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The teeth <b>32</b> on the discs <b>24</b> each have a profile comprising a straight leading edge <b>33</b>, a concave trailing edge <b>34</b>, and an outer edge <b>35</b> extending between respective outer ends of the leading edge <b>33</b> and the trailing edge <b>34</b>. The leading edge <b>33</b> of each tooth <b>32</b> is sharpened to create a leading cutting edge. By having the leading edge <b>33</b> sharpened, the teeth <b>32</b> will efficiently and effectively cut crop residue and other debris at any depth of operation up to the base <b>36</b> of the teeth <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The outer edges <b>35</b> of the teeth <b>32</b> are substantially circumferential with the disc <b>24</b>. That is, the outer edges <b>35</b> have a radius of curvature that is substantially equal to a radius of the disc <b>24</b>. The outer edges <b>35</b> lie in and define the outer path of rotation of the disc <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The outer edges <b>35</b> extend at an obtuse angle relative to the corresponding leading edges <b>33</b> of the tooth <b>32</b>. More precisely, a tangent to the outer edge <b>35</b> at the point of intersection between the leading edge <b>33</b> and outer edge <b>35</b> forms an obtuse angle relative to the leading edge <b>33</b>. For example, the outer edge <b>35</b> (or more precisely a tangent to the curved outer edge <b>35</b>) in the illustrated embodiment extends at an angle of approximately 120 degrees relative to the adjacent leading edge <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A sharp point <b>37</b> is formed at the abrupt transition where the leading cutting edge <b>33</b> of each tooth <b>32</b> intersects with the outer edge <b>35</b> thereof. This point <b>37</b> can also be described as a convex vertex formed at the intersection between the leading cutting edge <b>33</b> and the outer edge <b>35</b> of each tooth <b>32</b>. The sharp point <b>37</b> between the leading and outer edges <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> provides an aggressive cutting and clearing action and residue movement during operation, particularly at higher operating speeds.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 27</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the debris clearing apparatus <b>111</b> of the present invention. A planter row unit <b>100</b> equipped with the debris clearing apparatus <b>111</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The planter row unit <b>100</b> and the debris clearing apparatus <b>111</b> are the same as the planter row unit <b>10</b> and debris clearing apparatus <b>11</b> described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref>, except that the discs <b>124</b> in the debris clearing apparatus <b>111</b> are different than the discs <b>24</b> in the debris clearing apparatus <b>11</b>. The same reference numerals are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 13</figref> to refer to the common features of the planter row units <b>10</b> and <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The discs <b>124</b>A, <b>124</b>B of the debris clearing apparatus <b>111</b> each have a first side and an opposing second side. A plurality of teeth <b>132</b> extend from a periphery of each disc <b>124</b>A, <b>124</b>B. In the illustrated embodiment, each disc <b>124</b>A, <b>124</b>B has 12 teeth equally spaced around the disc at 30-degree intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It will be understood that the discs <b>124</b>A and <b>124</b>B are basically the same as each other, except that the beveled surfaces <b>138</b> of the teeth <b>132</b> (described below) are formed on the opposite side of the disc <b>124</b>A as compared to disc <b>124</b>B. Accordingly, the discs <b>124</b>A, <b>124</b>B will be described interchangeably herein by simply referring to them as discs <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The teeth <b>132</b> on the discs <b>124</b> each have a profile comprising a curved, convex leading edge <b>133</b>, and a concave trailing edge <b>134</b>. The leading edge <b>133</b> and trailing edge <b>134</b> intersect with each other to form the outer distal tip <b>135</b> of each tooth <b>132</b>. The outer distal tip <b>135</b> is a sharp point located at the intersection between the leading edge <b>133</b> and trailing edge <b>134</b> of each tooth <b>132</b>. The sharp point <b>135</b> between the leading and trailing edges <b>133</b>, <b>134</b> provides an aggressive cutting and clearing action and residue movement during operation, particularly at higher operating speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The leading edge <b>133</b> of each tooth <b>132</b> is sharpened to create a leading cutting edge. By having the leading edge <b>133</b> sharpened, the teeth <b>132</b> will efficiently and effectively cut crop residue and other debris at any depth of operation up to the base <b>136</b> of the teeth <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The leading edges <b>133</b> of the teeth <b>132</b> in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 23</figref> are sharpened by beveling from only one side of the disc <b>124</b>. The leading edges <b>133</b> can be beveled, for example, at an angle of approximately 30 to 60 degrees relative to a plane of the disc <b>124</b>. The beveled surfaces <b>138</b> are preferably on the side of the discs <b>124</b> facing away from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The leading edges <b>133</b> of each tooth <b>132</b> slope rearwardly relative to a direction of rotation of the disc <b>124</b> and a radial line passing through the tooth <b>132</b>. The rearward slope of the leading edges <b>133</b> increases from the base <b>136</b> of the tooth <b>132</b> to the distal tip <b>135</b> of each tooth <b>132</b> due to the convex curvature of the leading edge <b>133</b>. The sharpened leading edges <b>133</b> of the teeth <b>132</b> have been determined to improve the ability of the teeth <b>132</b> to cut through crop residue and other debris. The trailing edges <b>134</b> of the teeth <b>132</b> are straight and extend generally in a radial direction with a slightly rearward slope relative to a direction of rotation to encourage the crop residue and soil to fall off of the teeth <b>132</b> during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 to 27</figref> show a double-edged disc <b>124</b>C that can be use instead of the discs <b>124</b>A, <b>124</b>B in the debris clearing apparatus <b>111</b>. The leading edges <b>133</b> of the teeth <b>132</b> of the double-edged disc <b>124</b>C are sharpened by beveling from two sides of the disc <b>124</b>C. The leading edges <b>133</b> can be beveled, for example, from both sides of the disc <b>124</b>C at an angle of approximately 30 to 60 degrees relative to a plane of the disc <b>124</b>C. By beveling the sharpened leading edges <b>133</b> from two sides of the disc <b>124</b>C, the disc <b>124</b>C can be used on either the right or left side of the debris clearing apparatus <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As used in this application, the term &#x201c;leading edge&#x201d; is intended to mean that portion of the tooth of a disc that provides the leading surface of the tooth relative to the path of rotation of the disc when the disc is rotating in a normal direction of operation as the implement is moving in a forward direction through a field. The &#x201c;leading edge&#x201d; should have a substantial radial component so that the sharpened leading edge can extend a substantial distance from the base of the tooth to the distal tip of the tooth for improved cutting action across a substantial depth as the teeth penetrate the soil. The &#x201c;leading edge&#x201d; is not intended to mean an outer edge of the tooth or other portion of the disc that extends primarily in a circumferential direction of the disc.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As used in this application, the term &#x201c;sharpened&#x201d; is intended to mean an edge that has been beveled from at least one side to form a sharp edge or a relatively thin blunt edge between two opposing flat surfaces of a disc. A sharpened edge is not intended to include a blunt edge of a flat disc that has not been beveled on either side.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It should also be appreciated that other edges of the discs could also be sharpened without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the outer edges or trailing edges of the teeth could be sharpened to further enhance the ability of the teeth to cut through residue or clear residue during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The debris clearing apparatus of the present invention has been illustrated with two substantially flat discs arranged in a V-shaped configuration with the discs toed-in toward each other in a direction of forward movement. This allows a pair of discs to clear an area (e.g., a narrow strip for planting or fertilizing), with the discs moving the debris to each side of the cleared area. However, it should be appreciated that other configurations are also possible. For example, a single debris clearing disc can be used to clear an area, in which case the debris will be moved by the single disc to one side of the cleared area. For another example, the discs can be concave or dished, instead of substantially flat, to accommodate certain crop conditions in which a more aggressive turning of the soil is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While the invention has been specifically described in connection with specific embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that this is by way of illustration and not of limitation, and the scope of the appended claims should be construed as broadly as the prior art will permit.</p>
